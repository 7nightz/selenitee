    <h1>What is Selenite?</h1>
    <p>Selenite is an unblocked games website developed by <a href="https://github.com/skysthelimitt">me</a> and me only. I started Selenite in my free time, under the name "cools1te", where I just uploaded HTML files to padlet during February to April, after which, I created the <a href="https://d969e66d.cools1te.pages.dev/">first ever version of cools1te</a>, which would later begin to form what is now known as Selenite. From version 2 (cools1te) to version 4 (original Selenite), I kept this similar style of just cards on a website. Selenite has gone through many changes, from The Best Website Ever / cools1te on Padlet, to the first actual website under the same name, to egamepass, and finally Selenite. Version 5 signifies a new Selenite, and a new beginning, going from a simple project I made for my friends, to something I made for my school, to something that I want to grow bigger than me.</p>
